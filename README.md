# tiptap
3D printer driver implementation for Devin Pohly's Systems Programming in C

Consists of three parts that we implemented throughout the Semester

**Assignment 3:** (Part one), was the basic implementation of the 3d printer driver


**Assignment 4:** (part two), was writing a layer *above* the tiptap driver to load/save .3dm files


**Assignment 5:** was writing a layer *below* the 3d printer driver to create our own *networked* version of the tapcontrol function we called in assignment3 3.
